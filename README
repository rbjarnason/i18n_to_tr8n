I18nToTr8n
=============

This plugin will convert your complete Rails project from i18n calls to tr8n.  NB: This plugin is higly experimental, so before running, BACKUP YOUR CODE. It will touch your code and things always can go wrong!

Usage
=======
Should work as a rake command but for some reason rake doesnt load up the localizations so for now, at least in rails 3, it only works in rails console using
I18nToTr8n::Base.new

Installation
=======
rails plugin install git://github.com/rbjarnason/i18n_to_tr8n.git
